 ## Numeric Literals
 
 Integer literals can be written as:
 
 - A decimal number, with no prefix
 
 - A binary number, with a 0b prefix
 
 - An octal number, with a 0o prefix
 
 - A hexadecimal number, with a 0x prefix
 
 All of these integer literals have a decimal value of 17:
 */

let decimalInteger = 17
let binaryInteger = 0b10001       // 17 in binary notation
let octalInteger = 0o21           // 17 in octal notation
let hexadecimalInteger = 0x11     // 17 in hexadecimal notation



/*:
 ### Floating-point literals can be decimal (with no prefix), or hexadecimal (with a 0x prefix). They must always have a number (or hexadecimal number) on both sides of the decimal point. Decimal floats can also have an optional exponent, indicated by an uppercase or lowercase e; hexadecimal floats must have an exponent, indicated by an uppercase or lowercase p.
 
 ### For decimal numbers with an exponent of exp, the base number is multiplied by 10exp:
 
 ### - 1.25e2 means 1.25 x 102, or 125.0.
 
 ### - 1.25e-2 means 1.25 x 10-2, or 0.0125.
 
 ### For hexadecimal numbers with an exponent of exp, the base number is multiplied by 2exp:
 
 ### - 0xFp2 means 15 x 22, or 60.0.
 
 ### - 0xFp-2 means 15 x 2-2, or 3.75.‚Äù
 
 
 All of these floating-point literals have a decimal value of 12.1875:
 
 */

let decimalDouble = 12.1875
let exponentDouble = 1.21875e1
let hexadecimalDouble = 0xC.3p0

/*:
 ### Numeric literals can contain extra formatting to make them easier to read. Both integers and floats can be padded with extra zeros and can contain underscores to help with readability. Neither type of formatting affects the underlying value of the literal:
 */

let paddedDouble = 000123.456
let oneMillion = 1_000_000
let justOverOneMillion = 1_000_000.000_000_1


/*:
 ## Numeric Type Conversion
 ### Integer Conversion:
 - The range of numbers that can be stored in an integer constant or variable is different for each numeric type. An Int8 constant or variable can store numbers between -128 and 127, whereas a UInt8 constant or variable can store numbers between 0 and 255. A number that won‚Äôt fit into a constant or variable of a sized integer type is reported as an error when your code is compiled:
 
 - Because each numeric type can store a different range of values, you must opt in to numeric type conversion on a case-by-case basis. This opt-in approach prevents hidden conversion errors and helps make type conversion intentions explicit in your code.
 
 
 - To convert one specific number type to another, you initialize a new number of the desired type with the existing value. In the example below, the constant twoThousand is of type UInt16, whereas the constant one is of type UInt8. They can‚Äôt be added together directly, because they‚Äôre not of the same type. Instead, this example calls UInt16(one) to create a new UInt16 initialized with the value of one, and uses this value in place of the original:
 
 
 */

let twoThousand: UInt16 = 2_000
let one: UInt8 = 1
let twoThousandAndOne = twoThousand + UInt16(one)


/*:
 - Because both sides of the addition are now of type UInt16, the addition is allowed. The output constant (twoThousandAndOne) is inferred to be of type UInt16, because it‚Äôs the sum of two UInt16 values.
 
 - SomeType(ofInitialValue) is the default way to call the initializer of a Swift type and pass in an initial value. Behind the scenes, UInt16 has an initializer that accepts a UInt8 value, and so this initializer is used to make a new UInt16 from an existing UInt8. You can‚Äôt pass in any type here, however‚Äîit has to be a type for which UInt16 provides an initializer. Extending existing types to provide initializers that accept new types (including your own type definitions) is covered in Extensions.

// Prints "The status message is Not Found

/*:
 - You can name the individual elements in a tuple when the tuple is defined:
 */

 - If you name the elements in a tuple, you can use the element names to access the values of those elements:
 */

// Prints "The status code is 200"
print("The status message is \(http200Status.description)")

/*:
 # Optionals:
 You use optionals in situations where a value may be absent. An optional represents two possibilities: Either there is a value, and you can unwrap the optional to access that value, or there isn‚Äôt a value at all.
 
 An optional Int is written as Int?, not Int. The question mark indicates that the value it contains is optional, meaning that it might contain some Int value, or it might contain no value at all. (It can‚Äôt contain anything else, such as a Bool value or a String value. It‚Äôs either an Int, or it‚Äôs nothing at all.)
 
 You set an optional variable to a valueless state by assigning it the special value nil.
 
 Swift‚Äôs nil isn‚Äôt the same as nil in Objective-C. In Objective-C, nil is a pointer to a nonexistent object. In Swift, nil isn‚Äôt a pointer‚Äîit‚Äôs the absence of a value of a certain type. Optionals of any type can be set to nil, not just object types.
 */
let possibleNumber = "123"
let convertedNumber = Int(possibleNumber)

/*:
 ## If Statements and Forced Unwrapping
 You can use an if statement to find out whether an optional contains a value by comparing the optional against nil. You perform this comparison with the ‚Äúequal to‚Äù operator (==) or the ‚Äúnot equal to‚Äù operator (!=).
 */

if convertedNumber != nil {
    print("convertedNumber contains some integer value.")
}
// Prints "convertedNumber contains some integer value.

/*:
 ## Forced Unwrapping
 Once you‚Äôre sure that the optional does contain a value, you can access its underlying value by adding an exclamation mark (!) to the end of the optional‚Äôs name. The exclamation mark effectively says, ‚ÄúI know that this optional definitely has a value; please use it.‚Äù This is known as forced unwrapping of the optional‚Äôs value:
 */
if convertedNumber != nil {
    print("convertedNumber has an integer value of \(convertedNumber!).")
}
// Prints "convertedNumber has an integer value of 123.

/*:
 ## Optional Binding:
 You use optional binding to find out whether an optional contains a value, and if so, to make that value available as a temporary constant or variable.
 
 Optional Binding using if and guard as follow:
 */

// Using if
if let actualNumber = Int(possibleNumber) {
    print("The string \"\(possibleNumber)\" has an integer value of \(actualNumber)")
} else {
    print("The string \"\(possibleNumber)\" could not be converted to an integer")
}
// Prints "The string "123" has an integer value of 123"

// We can use guard as well

/*:
 You can include as many optional bindings and Boolean conditions in a single if statement as you need to, separated by commas.
 */

if let firstNumber = Int("4"), let secondNumber = Int("42"), firstNumber < secondNumber && secondNumber < 100 {
print("\(firstNumber) < \(secondNumber) < 100")
}
// Prints "4 < 42 < 100‚Äù

/*:
 ## Implicitly Unwrapped Optionals
 Sometimes it‚Äôs clear from a program‚Äôs structure that an optional will always have a value, after that value is first set. In these cases, it‚Äôs useful to remove the need to check and unwrap the optional‚Äôs value every time it‚Äôs accessed, because it can be safely assumed to have a value all of the time.
 These kinds of optionals are defined as implicitly unwrapped optionals.
 */
let possibleString: String? = "An optional string."
let forcedString: String = possibleString! // requires an exclamation mark

let assumedString: String! = "An implicitly unwrapped optional string."
let implicitString: String = assumedString // no need for an exclamation mark


/*:
 You will get runtime error if you will try to implicitely unwrape an optional which does not have value.
 You can still treat an implicitly unwrapped optional like a normal optional, to check if it contains a value:
 */
 
 if assumedString != nil {
 print(assumedString!)
 }
 // Prints "An implicitly unwrapped optional string.

/*:
 You can also use an implicitly unwrapped optional with optional binding, to check and unwrap its value in a single statement:
 */
if let definiteString = assumedString {
    print(definiteString)
}
// Prints "An implicitly unwrapped optional string.

/*:
 ## Assertions and Preconditions
 Assertions and preconditions are checks that happen at runtime. You use them to make sure an essential condition is satisfied before executing any further code. If the Boolean condition in the assertion or precondition evaluates to true, code execution continues as usual. If the condition evaluates to false, the current state of the program is invalid; code execution ends, and your app is terminated.
 
 The difference between assertions and preconditions is in when they‚Äôre checked: Assertions are checked only in debug builds, but preconditions are checked in both debug and production builds. In production builds, the condition inside an assertion isn‚Äôt evaluated. This means you can use as many ‚Äúassertions as you want during your development process, without impacting performance in production.
 */

/*:
 ## Debuging with Assertions
 You can omit the assertion message‚Äîfor example, when it would just repeat the condition as prose.

/*:
 You can omit the assertion message‚Äîfor example, when it would just repeat the condition as prose.
 */
//assert(age >= 0)  // Intentionally commented to test further code, you can uncomment it

/*:
 If the code already checks the condition, you use the assertionFailure(_:file:line:) function to indicate that an assertion has failed. For example:
 */

if age > 10 {
    print("You can ride the roller-coaster or the ferris wheel.")
} else if age >= 0 {
    print("You can ride the ferris wheel.")
} else {
//    assertionFailure("A person's age can't be less than zero.") // Intentionally commented to test further code, you can uncomment it
}

/*:
 ## Enforcing Preconditions
 Use a precondition whenever a condition has the potential to be false, but must definitely be true for your code to continue execution.
 */

// In the implementation of a subscript...
let numberPreCond = -1
//precondition(numberPreCond > 0, "Index must be greater than zero.")  // Intentionally commented to test further code, you can uncomment it

/*: Notes
    If you compile in unchecked mode (-Ounchecked), preconditions aren‚Äôt checked. The compiler assumes that preconditions are always true, and it optimizes your code accordingly. However, the fatalError(_:file:line:) function always halts execution, regardless of optimization settings.
 
    You can use the fatalError(_:file:line:) function during prototyping and early development to create stubs for functionality that hasn‚Äôt been implemented yet, by writing fatalError("Unimplemented") as the stub implementation. Because fatal errors are never optimized out, unlike assertions or preconditions, you can be sure that execution always halts if it encounters a stub implementation.
